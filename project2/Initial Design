 Initial Design:

Steps: 

1. rdt 1.0 CLIENT: 
	- create+bind socket
	- handshake
	- request packet with [header]
	- Send
	- - receive and parse to data
	- fin

   rdt 1.0 Server:
    - create+bind socket
    - listen for handshake
    - listen for more request
    - parse [header]
    - make packet with [header]
    - send
    - listen for fin 


Own designed header


Special requirements:
1. Call like ./server [hostname] [port]. | ./client [filename]
2. print messages when the server or the client is sending or receiving packets.
3. max packet size = 1024 b including header 
4. max window size = 5120 b
   max seq # = 30kb



5. time_out retrans; waiting time = 500ms
6. 2*RTO time for fin
