client part:
1. header design in tcp.cpp
2. handshake: update seq_nums and establish connection.
	use bookpage 254 tcp handshake design, and the third message doesn't carry data for simplicity
3. the only packet with data size not zero is the file request. The filename is inside the  data area. The filename is a c string with \0 at last.

server part:
1. handshake: update the seq and ack right and after every time
2. implement waiting with select


tcp part:
1. checksum
