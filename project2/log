client part:
1. header design in tcp.cpp
2. handshake: update seq_nums and establish connection.
	use bookpage 254 tcp handshake design, and the third message doesn't carry data for simplicity
3. the only packet with data size not zero is the file request. The filename is inside the  data area. The filename is a c string with \0 at last.

4.add timeout using poll

*handshake and file request are currently in rdt 1.0

server part:
1. handshake: update the seq and ack right and after every time
2. implement waiting with wait_for_packet, usage may be wrong
3. Use double pointer to implement slide window


tcp part:
1. checksum 



=======================================================
Difficulty:
1. different usage of socket for udp instead of tcp.
2. TIMEOUT implement: poll/select/socketopt


=======================================================
Leaving Problems:
1. Typeof struct pkt_t pkt_t
Finished.
2. Because of seq over-flow, create another seq for packet for far
